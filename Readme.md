Important note: Please run every main.py from inside its own respective folders!!! Don't run like Modelling/main.py you need to go inside the modelling folder and run python main.py 

The reasons being the input and the output of between modules is coded in a such a way it takes from different folders within the package and it requires running the main program from its own folder
